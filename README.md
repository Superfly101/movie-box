# Movie Box

A movie discovery web application that allows users to search for movies, view details about them, and save their favorite movies.

## Requirements

For development, you will only need Node.js and npm.

## Getting Started

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Superfly101/movie-box.git
```

Next, install dependecies:

```bash
cd movie-box
npm install
```

run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load a custom Google Font.
